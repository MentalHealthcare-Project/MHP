                At the beginning, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11,2020. The modern world faced its first global challenge, resulting in the world's shutdown. All economic and social activities came to a halt as governments worldwide undertook extreme measures to ensure that their citizens were safe from this new unidentified virus which seemed to affect primarily older adults and persons who had compromised immune systems. The new measures imposed by governments, including safety tips, and closing down social and economic gatherings, resulted in a massive mental impact on the various people of society.

                People's mental health and overall well-being have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic, raising considerable concerns about mental health issues on a global scale. There is broad consensus that the COVID-19 Pandemic impacts people's total wellness, including physical and psychological health.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The emotional, psychological, and social well-being of an individual is known as mental health. The feelings, thoughts, and acts of an individual are what affects mental wellbeing. Stress handling, relationships with others, and making choices are some of the determinants of the mental health of an individual. From childhood and adolescence to adulthood mental health is   important at every stage of life (Bernaras, Jaureguizar, & Garaigordobil, 2019).

                The Normal responses to the real threats as fear, worry, and stress are the normal responses that are faced due to uncertainty of the unknown. So, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic people are experiencing fear and anxiety due to the situation.

                New York City has once again found itself in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a sharp rise in cases over the past few weeks. In NYC, 203,000 cases of COVID-19 with laboratory confirmation were reported in the first three months of the pandemic. The overall crude fatality rate for confirmed cases was 9.2%, and the rate for hospitalized patients was 32.1%. This has led to concerns about the ability of the city's healthcare system to cope with the influx of patients. The outbreak is concentrated in certain parts of the city, with areas such as Queens and Brooklyn being particularly hard-hit.

                <br/>
                The city government has responded by increasing testing and vaccination efforts in the affected areas. Mobile testing sites have been set up in many neighborhoods, and vaccine clinics have been opened in community centers and other public spaces. Mayor Eric Adams has urged all residents to get vaccinated, emphasizing that the vaccines are safe, effective, and the best way to protect oneself and others from the virus. Despite these efforts, the situation remains serious. Hospitals are reporting a shortage of beds and other resources, and healthcare workers are once again facing long hours and difficult conditions. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The current outbreak in New York City is a stark reminder that the pandemic is far from over. While vaccination rates have improved in recent months, there are still many people who remain unvaccinated or who are hesitant to get vaccinated. This is particularly true in certain communities, where there may be distrust of the healthcare system or other cultural factors at play. As the city continues to grapple with the current crisis, it is clear that more needs to be done to ensure that all residents have access to healthcare, testing, and vaccination.

                It has had a profound negative effect on the mental health of the nation, especially among those
            who are faced with combating the virus. While many throughout the U.S. are coping with the
            fear and uncertainty of COVID-19 from their homes, essential workers, including healthcare
            workers, must expose themselves to the virus every day. Healthcare workers are also
            experiencing conditions that have been compared to a war zone, continuously witnessing the
            direct effects of the pandemic as it spreads throughout communities. It is essential that we
            provide resources to help healthcare workers cope with the mental health impact of their work.

            According to 
            <a href=https://mhanational.org/mental-health-healthcare-workers-covid-19>Mental Health America </a>Many healthcare workers were stressed out and stretched too thin: 93% of health care workers
            were experiencing stress, 86% reported experiencing anxiety, 77% reported frustration, 76%
            reported exhaustion and burnout, and 75% said they were overwhelmed. Worried about exposing
            loved ones: 76% of healthcare workers with children reported that they were worried about
            exposing their child to COVID-19, nearly half were worried about exposing their spouse or
            partner, and 47% were worried that they would expose their older adult family member(s).
            Emotionally and physically exhausted: Emotional exhaustion was the most common answer for
            changes in how healthcare workers were feeling over the previous three months (82%), followed
            by trouble with sleep (70%), physical exhaustion (68%) and work-related dread (63%).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Over half selected changes in appetite (57%), physical symptoms like headache or stomach ache
            (56%), questioning career path (55%), compassion fatigue (52%) and heightened awareness or
            attention to being exposed (52%). Nurses reported having a higher exposure to COVID-19 (41%)
            and they were more likely to feel too tired (67%) compared to other healthcare workers (63%).
            Not getting enough emotional support: Thirty-nine percent of healthcare workers said that they
            did not feel like they had adequate emotional support. Nurses were even less likely to have
            emotional support (45%). Struggling with parenting: Among people with children, half reported
            they are lacking quality time or are unable to support their children or be a present parent.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Healthcare workers consist of many different individuals who are in many different professions
            in the same field such as social workers, therapists, mental health specialists, nurses, and so
            much more.

            She discusses the team of workers that
            served alongside her and how they were managing taking care of children and families while
            also dealing with their emotions of Covid and how it affected them way more now that they were
            put in tough positions.

            Jason Schaefer, a Mental Health Specialist at Northwell Health discusses the pandemic
            overall and how he has begun to see his own therapist, not as if anything was wrong but being
            able to deal with the balance of taking on more clients than usual and still being able to thrive in
            that setting alongside his co workers.

            Overall, they talk about the major directions that they were
            pulled in and how that emotionally shifted through the pandemic and after.

            Alison Lopresti Zuber, a mental health specialist at Cheston Elementary School says the this time in
             life has been extremely difficult because of the unknowing.

             She constantly stressed about not 
             knowing what will happen in school, in the community, both as an educator and parent. For being an 
             educator, she struggled the most with having to learn new online programs at a fast rate, while also
              making sure the students grasp the new programs as well.
